2015-06-24: Downloaded data and started thinking

Kaggle Crime ideas:

Crime correlates with weather. Get weather data from the datetime stamp. I did this with bike sharing.
What about economic indicators like unemployment and poverty rates?
Can I find information about alcohol/drug consumption?
How to handle location information? 
demographic information of districts?
Seasonal patterns?

Wikipedia has an article on Statistical correlations of criminal behaviour:

Here is another interesting article:

There are major outliers in X and Y. Why are they there? SF crimes happening way outside SF? Must do outlier removal.

Added functionality for downloading and using weather data and unemployment data. It didn't have an immediate impact on my log loss scores, but I will continue experimenting.

The X and Y outliers appear to be arbitrary placeholders, probably because the intersections entered by police couldn't be found by the map software. I started manually adding the correct lattitude and longitude in and discovered that most are intersections where the street name changes before the intersection. There are only about a hundred cases in the testing set, out of nearly 900,000 crimes, so it is mostly unimportant.

Upon closer inspection of the rules, external data is not allowed. So, I guess this will just be for fun.
